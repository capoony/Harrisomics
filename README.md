# Harrisomics: Partridge and Quail Comparative Genomics Pipeline

This pipeline provides a comprehensive workflow for analyzing partridge and quail sequencing data, from raw historical DNA (hDNA) samples through to comparative genomics and phylogenetic reconstruction. The pipeline is specifically designed for historical specimens and includes extensive decontamination, de novo assembly, and phylogenomic analysis focused on partridge and quail evolutionary relationships.

## Overview

The Harrisomics pipeline processes museum specimens of partridges and quails to:

- Extract and analyze endogenous DNA from historical samples
- Remove contaminant DNA from various sources
- Perform de novo genome assembly
- Download and analyze reference genomes from partridge and quail species
- Conduct phylogenomic analysis using BUSCO genes
- Reconstruct evolutionary relationships within Phasianidae

## Sample Focus: HBCG002

This README presents detailed results for sample **HBCG002**, a historical **Perdix** (grey partridge) specimen from the Harrison collection. The analysis reveals excellent endogenous DNA preservation with 91.5% of mitochondrial reads mapping to *Perdix*, making it an ideal sample for demonstrating the pipeline's capabilities.

## Running the Pipeline

The complete pipeline is implemented in: `shell/main.sh`

To run the entire pipeline:

```bash
bash shell/main.sh
```

**Prerequisites:**

- Conda environments with required tools (fastp, BUSCO, MAFFT, RAxML)
- Access to ECMSD and AutDeNovo pipelines
- Required databases (BUSCO aves_odb10, NCBI nt, etc.)

## Sample Information

| Sample ID | Species | Source | Specimen Type | Raw Data Location |
|-----------|---------|--------|---------------|-------------------|
| HBCG002 | *Perdix* sp. (Grey Partridge) | Harrison Collection | Historical museum specimen | `/media/inter/mschwentner/Vogel_Harrison/demultiplexed/` |

## Pipeline Steps & Results for HBCG002

### 1. **Data Acquisition**

**Process:** Raw paired-end sequencing files are copied from the central data repository.

**Files:**

- `HBCG002.1.fastq.gz` (R1 reads)
- `HBCG002.2.fastq.gz` (R2 reads)

### 2. **Read Trimming and Quality Control (fastp)**

**Process:** Reads are quality-trimmed, adapter-removed, merged, and deduplicated using `fastp`.

**Outputs:**

- Trimmed paired-end reads: `data/trimmed/HBCG002_1_trimmed.fastq.gz`, `data/trimmed/HBCG002_2_trimmed.fastq.gz`
- Merged reads: `data/trimmed/HBCG002_merged.fastq.gz`
- Quality reports: `data/trimmed/HBCG002.html`, `data/trimmed/HBCG002.json`

**Key Metrics for HBCG002:**

- **Total raw reads:** 139,685,366 (paired-end)
- **Total raw bases:** 20.25 billion bp
- **Read length:** 145 bp (before processing)
- **Quality-filtered reads:** 67,280,420 reads retained
- **Mean read length after processing:** 78 bp
- **Q20 rate (after filtering):** 98.7%
- **Q30 rate (after filtering):** 95.2%
- **GC content:** 42.6% (after filtering)
- **Duplication rate:** 1.46%
- **Adapter contamination:** Detected and removed from 94.4% of reads

**Interpretation:** The sequencing data shows excellent quality with high Q20/Q30 scores after filtering. The reduction in read length (145→78 bp) and moderate adapter contamination are typical for historical DNA samples. The low duplication rate suggests good library complexity.

### 3. **ECMSD Pipeline - Metagenomic Contamination Assessment**

**Process:** Trimmed reads are analyzed using the ECMSD pipeline to identify mitochondrial content and assess contamination levels.

**Parameters:**

- Mapping quality threshold: 20
- Bin size: 1000bp
- RMUS threshold: 0.15
- Taxonomic hierarchy: genus level

**Outputs:** `results/ECMSD/HBCG002/`

- Contamination assessment reports
- Mitochondrial read identification
- Taxonomic composition analysis

**Key Results for HBCG002:**

- **Endogenous DNA content:** 91.5% of mitochondrial reads map to *Perdix* (grey partridge)
- **Primary contaminant:** *Penicillium* (fungal contamination, 7.0% of reads)
- **Secondary contaminants:** *Aspergillus* (0.77%), *Taxus* (0.22%)
- **Other galliform genera detected:** *Chrysolophus*, *Lophura*, *Phasianus*, *Pavo*, *Gallus* (trace amounts)
- **Total mitochondrial reads analyzed:** 32,158 reads

**Interpretation:** HBCG002 shows exceptional preservation with >91% endogenous content. The specimen is clearly identified as *Perdix* sp. (grey partridge). Minor fungal contamination is typical for museum specimens. The detection of related galliform genera likely represents database cross-mapping due to sequence similarity.
